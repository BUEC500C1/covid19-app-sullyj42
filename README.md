# covid19-app-sullyj42
This repository contains Flask files for Assignment 7 of EC500, Boston University, Spring 2020

Initially, this will mostly contain the folder for the Udemy course detailing the basics of 

Once that course is partially completed, I will add new folders to detail the assignment completion

Once that is done, I will refactor into the proper branches (Map, PostMan Covid)

Update: April 20, 2020

Implimented a simple maps utility.

Currently brings up a simple set of screens to show a map and (in the future) select the type of covid data to overlay

Screens: 
-- Map: Display a google map. Allow some user selection of overlaid data (currently implimented date)
-- MapSettings: Change settigns for the map. Currently unused
-- -- May be useful as an intermediate before overlaying more advanced features onto Map
-- Data: More in-depth screen to interface with Covid data available
-- -- Not yet implimented (beginning to explore this in the next step, in seperate repo)
